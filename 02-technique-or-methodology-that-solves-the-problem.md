The authors used a qualitative research approach to survey industry professionals who identified themselves as agile leaders. The group comprises scrum masters, company founders, agile coaches, and project managers. The authors diversified the participants by picking people from different countries, company sizes, genders, and age groups. Their only commonality is that they all identify as agile leaders.

The surveys were carried out as 45 to 90 minutes of semi-structured interviews. Some were conducted online with video conferencing; some were conducted face-to-face. This survey will then be transcribed for further analysis. The authors will review the transcripts and determine the statements relevant to the research topic ("leadership"). They will then group the statements into categories and re-assess, refine and rephrase each category until they find each statement supports a common theme.
