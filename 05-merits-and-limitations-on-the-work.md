The tension between company culture and agile value is inevitable. The paper should provide a cost-benefit matrix between agile principles and trade-offs but did not. Shared leadership and social identity are non-negotiable because they motivate the team and boost productivity. However, while deemed counterproductive in agile, documentation and validation might become necessary again, as many companies turned to hybrid or distributed teams after the COVID pandemic. The reduced face-to-face communication prompts more documentation and validations, as this is the only way to confirm that everyone is on the same page. 

The authors should also expand the contract-based interaction between an agile team and its customers. It is doubtful if customers would agree on a fixed price but flexible scope contract. If not, agile teams become something that could live within in-house projects. Even if customers say yes to a contract with a flexible scope, it will likely come with other static terms with a more abstract requirement, for example, user satisfaction. 

Finally, when is the best time for formal leaders to step in during shared leadership? Too early inhibits the team's initiative; too late hurts the team's velocity and put the project timeline at risk. The best way for a leader to step in is not to provide imperative guidance. However, it should instead be in the form of asking inquisitive questions to encourage critical thinking and generate new ideas.
