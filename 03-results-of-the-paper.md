The authors discovered three vital elements in agile leadership. They are dynamic team leadership, social identity, and organizational culture. 


Dynamic team leadership

Most participants believed in shared leadership, i.e., the whole team's rotation of the leadership role. They emphasized the importance of letting team members make decisions and take the initiative independently.

Allowing team members making changes have the added benefit of neutralizing negative thoughts. People are more tolerant of issues as soon as they can fix them. Negative thoughts are only destructive if what the team complains about is beyond their control. 

Members more active in agile leadership are passionate about that work and are usually more focused on implementing agile principles. As a result, the team becomes more collaborative and self-organized. Having such motivated initiators in the team could also encourage others to do the same and make shared leadership a team value. However, there are concerns about shared leadership because sharing leadership also shares the responsibilities of a project, including failures.

Shared leadership not only applies to technical and engineering issues but should also be applied to the general improvement and all organizational issues. Although early guidance on critical issues is often necessary, The formal leadership role should teach when to take a step back and observe. Otherwise, it could undermine the team's initiative when members are ready for increased responsibility. To strike a balance between efficiency and individual initiative. The agile team can define rules for when the formal leader steps in to make decisions. Having the support of the formal leader also has an added benefit for the team members to validate issues with the leader and learn to make better decisions. 

Social Identity

All participants agreed that cross-functional teams have a higher team spirit because their members can take the initiative independently instead of working in a separate functional silo. The member sees that they are contributing to the common goal. As a result of this high team spirit, the members are more willing to take responsibility. 

However, there are concerns about the separation of roles within the teams. i.e., silos within a cross-functional team. Some participants identified this issue and tried to transfer technical knowledge among individual members. Members with cross-functional skills can contribute more and, as a result, identify more with the overall team goals than just their formal functional role. 

Some efforts were made to integrate customers into the agile team; participants felt customer integration made the team more successful; others felt that their work was undervalued without the customer's integration.

Participants derived many helpful ways of building social identity: Having the team sit and work closely together. Conduct agile ceremonies, such as retrospective meetings and daily stand-ups. Some teams even perform unnecessary ceremonies, such as deployment during the daytime, to get everyone involved and share a common sense of achievement.

Organizational Culture

Companies like agile because of the increased productivity, but companies would often like to retain the existing functional silos and top-down power structures. The companies must appreciate that the agile transition implies a complete cultural change. Adopting agile without fully embracing its principle undermines the benefits that it promised. 

Participants find there is tension with the idea of standardizing agile practices. A standardized practice undermines the diversity of projects. Instead of standardizing practice, they feel the focus should be on implementing agile principles while tailor-making practices for different projects. For example, some participants tried to adopt the waterfall model with an incremental flavor. Others tried to implement full agile within the team but shielded the team from the organization's management control. 

The transition to agile is a difficult one for the organization as well as individuals. Some describe changing people as the most challenging part. Individual contributors are so used to the old way of working that they need help following the new practices. For leadership, On the other letting go of control and trusting the team.

A common theme with agile leaders is that they often have to balance agile principles and the external environment. However, the leaders often may not be able to fully grasp the concerns of other functions in the company and create a project-based silo. Participants tried to solve the issue by setting up a business council within the team, which consists of representatives from different functions, and syncing up regularly to review priorities and remove silos. 

Agile teams also felt they needed to reduce their velocity to adapt to their customers because agile teams could deliver changes more quickly and more often than their milestone-driven counterparts. 

The final tension comes from contracting. Traditional contracts that define the project with a fixed price and scope are incompatible with agile. Participants feel that contracts should now be defined with a fixed price but a flexible scope rather than defining fixed price and fixed scope.
