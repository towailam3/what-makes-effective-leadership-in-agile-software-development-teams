The authors discovered three vital elements in agile leadership. They are dynamic team leadership, social identity, and organizational culture. 


Dynamic team leadership

Most participants believed in shared leadership, i.e., the whole team's rotation of the leadership role. They emphasized the importance of letting team members make decisions and take the initiative independently.

Allowing team members making changes have the added benefit of neutralizing negative thoughts. People are more tolerant of issues as soon as they can fix them. Negative thoughts are only destructive if what the team complains about is beyond their control. 

Members more active in agile leadership are passionate about that work and are usually more focused on implementing agile principles. As a result, the team becomes more collaborative and self-organized. Having such motivated initiators in the team could also encourage others to do the same and make shared leadership a team value. However, there are concerns about shared leadership because sharing leadership also shares the responsibilities of a project, including failures.

Shared leadership not only applies to technical and engineering issues but should also be applied to the general improvement and all organizational issues. Although early guidance on critical issues is often necessary, The formal leadership role should teach when to take a step back and observe. Otherwise, it could undermine the team's initiative when members are ready for increased responsibility. To strike a balance between efficiency and individual initiative. The agile team can define rules for when the formal leader steps in to make decisions. Having the support of the formal leader also has an added benefit for the team members to validate issues with the leader and learn to make better decisions. 

Social Identity

All participants agreed that cross-functional teams have a higher team spirit because their members can take the initiative independently instead of working in a separate functional silo. The member sees that they are contributing to the common goal. As a result of this high team spirit, the members are more willing to take responsibility. 

However, there are concerns about the separation of roles within the teams. i.e., silos within a cross-functional team. Some participants identified this issue and tried to transfer technical knowledge among individual members. Members with cross-functional skills can contribute more and, as a result, identify more with the overall team goals than just their formal functional role. 

Some efforts were made to integrate customers into the agile team; participants felt customer integration made the team more successful; others felt that their work was undervalued without the customer's integration.

Participants derived many helpful ways of building social identity: Having the team sit and work closely together. Conduct agile ceremonies, such as retrospective meetings and daily stand-ups. Some teams even perform unnecessary ceremonies, such as deployment during the daytime, to get everyone involved and share a common sense of achievement.
