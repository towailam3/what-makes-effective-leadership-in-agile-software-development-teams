The problem is crucial because it explores the following conflicts. 

Top-down vs. peer-to-peer - where agile focus on decentralized coordination, top-down leadership focuses more on centralized decision-making. The two management paradigms, at face value, challenge the fundamental values of the other. But little's has been done to combine the two paradigms and generate synergy. 

Old and new - big organizations like the productivity increase of agile methodology, but rather than adopting cross-functional teams and peer-based decision-making. Organizations want to retain the existing organizational structure and power hierarchy. as a result, agile practitioners are forced to work in a hybrid environment. But they often struggle to prioritize the values of the product team over that of the larger organizations. 

Slow and quick - owing to the stress of response to change, an agile team could usually deliver much faster than their customers would expect. In other words, agile shortened the turnaround time, as expected by their customers. But the higher delivery rate overwhelmed their customers, and that agile teams were requested to slow down. 

Fixed and flexible - one of the most significant issues of agile project management is the negotiation of fixed-price contracts rather than defining a fixed scope and price. Agile suggests projects be defined with a flexible scope. The lack of a clear scope creates uncertainty that might drive away customers.
